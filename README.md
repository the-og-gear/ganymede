# Ganymede
A discord bot repo, again? Who knew!

----------

### Warning!
This source was never meant to be *portable*, it was only meant for a general storage. Modules *are* missing, and the config file would need reverse engineered.

If you wish to attempt modification, reverse engineering, or any form of such with this code, you are required to DM `Gear#4460` on Discord (or me, here on Git, you can make an issue requesting permission) for the permission.

----------

Regarding the code, it is documented to the extent I see fit. I don't comment every line, though I do add them as I see them needed, mainly for obscure functions and for what paramters, preconditions, and outputs you get from functions.

----------

This was created using my own framework as a base.
